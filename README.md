Hi, I'm Yoav 👋

I'm an M.Sc. student in computational biology at Tel Aviv University. I’m currently working on mitonuclear incompatibility and sympatric speciation in killer whales 🐳.

Most of my work combines evolutionary biology with computational tools. I use Python for simulations, modelling, and data analysis, and I’m generally interested in how complex evolutionary processes play out in real populations.

My background is in ecology and systematics, and I’ve also spent a lot of time teaching and doing science communication. On this GitHub you’ll mostly find the code behind my modelling projects, analysis scripts, and small tools I built along the way.

Always happy to talk about evolution, modelling ideas, or anything related to population genetics and ecology.

Hi!

I'm a M.Sc. student in computational biology at Tel Aviv University, working on mitonuclear incompatibility and sympatric speciation in killer whales :whale:. 

My background combines research in ecology and systematics with science communication and teaching. 

I apply computational tools and data analysis to problems in evolutionary biology, with experience in modeling, simulation, and working across theory and empirical data. 

My background includes Python programming, scientific computing, and interdisciplinary research in ecology, evolution, and genetics. 

Experienced in leading teams, developing educational programs, and teaching. 

Excellent interpersonal skills, task-oriented, and driven to make an impact both academically and socially.
